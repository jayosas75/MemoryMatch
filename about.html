        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p class="about_p">
            The main game plan idea is to match cards together until all the cards are matching and facing up.
            This plays slightly different as there is an RPG element added in as there is actions that occur whenever
            cards are matched, or whenever cards are mismatched. The objective is still to match cards; however, now if
            mess up too many time in a row you will start to more health until you die and consequence lose the game.
        </p>
        <p class="about_p">
            The personal reason for doing this project was to practice my coding skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript,
            and jQuery. The basic skeleton was done in HTML. The CSS is there to make the page's design pleasing to
            users. To power the game, I use Javascript and jQuery in order to do the card flipping and other game
            functionalities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hope you enjoy the game!
