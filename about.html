    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/avatar.jpg">
        <p>I am an aspiring web developer. In my previous life I was a mainframe programmer, a librarian and some other things. I enjoy hanging out with my pet parrots, and reading novels and non-fiction on various topics. My goal is to be a happy productive developer and work in an organization where I can both be a learner and a teacher. My favorite thing about this career is that it makes my brain work hard every day!</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>In my previous job, I supported an outside design firm in enhancing my organization's website. This required a lot of SQL, knowledge of the Sitecore CMS and some knowledge of C#/asp.net. My responsibilities included assisting with the data migration from the old site, testing, and migrating code to the staging and live sites.</p>
