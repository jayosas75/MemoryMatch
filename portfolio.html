        <h1>Elizabeth Alfano's Portfolio</h1>
        <h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>
        <p>I am an aspiring web developer. In my previous life I was a mainframe programmer, a librarian and some other things. I enjoy hanging out with my pet parrots, and reading novels and non-fiction on various topics. My goal is to be a happy productive developer and work in an organization where I can both be a learner and a teacher. My favorite thing about this career is that it makes my brain work hard every day!</p>
        <!--Feature set 1 - Why you are taking this class-->
        <p>I enrolled in the LearningFuze program because I wanted to take a step back to ground myself in the fundamental concepts of web development and add to my set of skills. I believe this will make me a more productive and happy developer and put me in the perfect position to continue learning.</p>
        <!--Feature set 1 - What type of job you want to get-->
        <p>After LearningFuze, I hope to get a job as a web/software developer in a company where collaboration and learning are top priorities. That is what I would like to do for the rest of my career--keep learning and having fun developing great applications and websites.</p>
        <!--Feature set 1 - Why you are hungry for that job-->
        <p>Working in a company like this is my dream because it will give me the personal satisfaction of both doing excellent work that will empower my coworkers and the customers who use the applications that we develop. Part of this is working with others so that we can all grow into better developers and people. It is important to me to contibute to making my little part of the world a better place.</p>
