## Technologies used:
- HTML/CSS
- jQuery

## Summary 
- This is a NFL themed Memory Match game. With a combination of HTML/CSS and jQuery I have brought the childhood game back to life with this adaptation.

- You can flip 2 cards at a time and if you get all 9 matches you win. If you get 5 wrong in a row you have been "sacked" 5 times and you fumble and lose the game! But it's okay, you can always reset and try again.

- Firebase functionality coming soon!
